## About The Project

This project was developed to help users plan and put some tasks in their daily life as a reminder. You can add the tasks you need to complete during the day to the list. You can delete tasks you stopped doing, update tasks you want to change, and strikethrough tasks you have completed.

## Built With

While developing this project, JavaScript was used as the programming language. It was written in ECMAScript 6 and above standards and developed with a functional programming paradigm. JavaScript DOM manipulation is applied, and Bootstrap 5 features are used for interfaces and information messages. In addition, data loss was prevented by using Local Storage in order to store the data received from the user.
